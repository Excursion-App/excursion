## Description

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**

   Excurison is an app that helps people plan group vacations. We currently have a basic react app, the front end is mostly build out and people are able to plan a basic trip. 
   
   The status of my project at this moment is that there are for pages where a user can navigate to each page, but it does not populate the choices of the user on the last page (dashboard). Also there are buttons on the nav bar for user login but at the moment, it doesn't work.
   
   I hope to achieve more user functionality where a user can store a vacation and populate the dashboard.

## Objective 1: Add breadcrumbs for user to keep track where they are to complete it.

**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 

   There are currently 4 pages before the user gets to the dashboard and more will be added. We would like the user to be able to know where they are in the process. I also would like to add a modal to show completion.
   
**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 

   The user will be able to see breadcrumbs on each page except for the first page 

## Objective 2: Add user authentication
**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?**

Login is very essential to how our project works. We would like to create a sense of personalization. Users need to be able to login in order to see their trips. Each user or group of users should have a personalized dashboard.

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 

The login and signin buttons on the nav bar should work.

## Objective 3: Add dropdown of locations for guest to travel to
**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 

To minimize spelling errors, it is essential to use a dropdown menu. It will also be a better experience for the user.

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 
Drop down menu will be on `/destination` route.

## Stretch goals (optional):

**What stretch goals do you have for your project?**

   Add user authorization based on roles (Trip leader vs guests)
